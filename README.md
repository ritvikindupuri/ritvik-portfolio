## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher recommended) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This project requires environment variables to connect to Supabase. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the following:

    ```.env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="httpsYOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
    ```
    *You can find these keys in your Supabase project's API settings.*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view it in your browser.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is ready to be deployed! The easiest way to deploy a Vite + React application is by using a static hosting provider like:

* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

These platforms will typically detect that you are using Vite, build the project, and deploy it from your main branch automatically. Just connect your GitHub repository and follow their setup instructions.
